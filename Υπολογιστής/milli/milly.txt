                                        MILLIONAIRE GAME RULES

The Who Wants to Be a Millionaire questions are structured according to five different Levels with each level increasing
in difficulty. Each level contains three questions.

Questions that are grouped into the same level will all be of similar difficulty. For example: Questions 1-3 make up the
first Level and will contain the easiest questions. The second Level (Questions 4 - 6) will be slightly more difficult,
followed by the third Level (Questions 7-9). The fourth Level (Questions 10-12) will consist of really difficult
questions, followed by the fifth, and last, level (Questions 13 - 15) that will pose the most difficult questions of
the game.

It is important to remember that the questions which make up each level will not necessarily relate to the same or even
similar topics, but their overall level of difficulty will be the same.
